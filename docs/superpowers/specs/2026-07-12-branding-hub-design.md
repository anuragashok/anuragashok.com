# anuragashok.com — Personal Branding Hub (Phase 1 + 2)

Date: 2026-07-12
Status: Approved design, pending implementation plan

## Premise

This repo is not a website. It is **everything-as-code applied to a person** — a canonical,
version-controlled source of truth about Anurag Ashok, which *renders* to a website and
(later) *pushes* to every platform he exists on. Same idea as his `dotfiles` repo, pointed
at identity instead of a shell.

The website is the first renderer of that source of truth. It is not the source of truth.

## Why rebuild

The previous site was a well-built empty shell: one placeholder post, a blank "Now" section,
no bio, no role, no projects. `anuragashok.com` itself 404s — only `anuragashok-com.vercel.app`
resolves. The stack was fine; the substance was missing and the framing was wrong (a blog that
happened to have an About page, rather than a profile that happens to render a blog).

Decision: **clean slate.** Empty the repo, rebuild.

## Subject facts (canonical, as of 2026-07-12)

- Anurag Ashok — Lead Software Engineer, **Grab**, Singapore.
- Team: **Fulfillment Dispatch** — matching supply to demand across Southeast Asia.
- Writing software since **February 2013** (~13 years).
- **Individual contributor by choice**, and intends to stay one.
- Throughline: automation → infrastructure-as-code → everything-as-code → **agentic coding**.
  Self-described problem solver.
- Previously: Singapore Airlines.
- LinkedIn: `linkedin.com/in/anurag-ashok/`. GitHub: `github.com/anuragashok`.
- **Not** open to recruitment. Drop the `hireable` flag.
- **No X/Twitter.** The `x.com/anuragashok` link in the old config is unverified and gets cut.

Prior bio material found online (dev.to, Medium, GitHub) is ~5 years stale — written at
Singapore Airlines, claiming "8+ years." Do not reuse it verbatim.

## Scope decomposition

The full hub is four subsystems. Only 1 and 2 are in this spec.

| # | Subsystem | Status |
|---|-----------|--------|
| 1 | **Profile-as-code + site** — typed canonical data, visual brand, real content | **This spec** |
| 2 | **Writing** — markdown pipeline, near-zero-friction authoring | **This spec** |
| 3 | **Syndication out** — push posts to dev.to / Medium / LinkedIn, canonical links home | Deferred |
| 4 | **Identity propagation** — generate GitHub README, OG images, LinkedIn headline/banner | Deferred |

3 and 4 are useless without a canonical source and real content to push. They are tracked as
GitHub issues under milestones, not built here.

## Architecture

pnpm workspace:

```
packages/profile/       me.yaml + schema.ts  →  the canonical Anurag. Zero framework deps.
content/posts/          *.md                 →  canonical writing. Markdown is source of truth.
apps/site/              Next.js 16 renderer. Imports both. Owns neither.
```

**The load-bearing rule: `packages/profile` never imports from `apps/site`.**

The profile is the product; the site is its first renderer. Phase 3 adds `packages/cli`
importing the same package to push to dev.to / LinkedIn / GitHub — and it costs nothing to add
because the boundary existed from day one. Violating this rule collapses the entire thesis of
the project into "a blog with a data file."

`me.yaml` is a real YAML file, zod-parsed at build time. The About page renders **the actual
file contents**, syntax-highlighted — not a re-serialization of a parsed object. The thing on
screen is the thing in git. That identity is the point, and it is a hard requirement.

## Site surfaces

`/` · `/writing` · `/writing/[slug]` · `/about` · `feed.xml` · `sitemap.xml` · `robots.txt` ·
OG images · 404.

Nothing else. No projects page, no `/now`, no `/uses`. Every page is a page that has to be
kept alive; the old site died of unkept pages.

Route is `/writing`, not `/blog`. Nothing external links to the old `/blog` paths, so no
redirects are needed.

**Home** is reading-first: serif hero, short bio, a list of recent writing, nothing competing
with the words.

**About** is where the manifest lands: prose paragraphs, then `me.yaml` rendered as itself,
with a line noting it is the same object that will later generate the GitHub README and
LinkedIn headline. The concept is the reward for scrolling, not the wallpaper.

## Visual system (locked)

- **Instrument Serif** — headlines only (`I make code work.`)
- **Inter** — body
- **IBM Plex Mono** — all metadata, and the manifest block
- Paper `#FAF9F7` · Ink `#16150F` · Burnt amber `#B45309` (single accent)
- Dark mode as a designed inversion, not a derived one.
- Manifest block appears on **About only**.

Direction was chosen against two alternatives (a dark monospace "Terminal" direction and a
full "Manifest" direction where the whole homepage rendered as YAML). Verdict: *the manifest
is the idea, the editorial layout is the site.* A joke that lands once should not be the
permanent frame for essays meant to be read.

Copy ships as written during design — accurate, and good enough to launch. Refine later.

## Content pipeline

- Markdown with zod-validated frontmatter: `title`, `date`, `summary`, `tags`, `draft`.
- Shiki for code highlighting. Reading time computed at build.
- `draft: true` — excluded from production builds, visible in dev.
- Authoring ritual: write the `.md` (by hand or with an agent), commit, push, deployed.
  An agent is a *tool for producing markdown* — never a layer between the author and the file.
  Markdown in the repo stays canonical, always.

**Launch content:** the 5 posts from `theoverengineered.blog` (Dec 2020 – Feb 2021).
**Migration is DONE** — they are committed as markdown in `content/posts/`, under version
control for the first time.

| slug | date |
|---|---|
| `initial-post` | 2020-12-19 |
| `generate-rss-and-sitemap-for-nextjs-jamstack-site` | 2020-12-27 |
| `use-docker-for-local-development` | 2021-01-03 |
| `capture-response-time-in-wiremock-recordings` | 2021-02-06 |
| `publishing-my-first-artifact-to-maven-central-using-github-actions` | 2021-02-27 |

**How, and why it matters:** the old blog was a Next.js frontend over Contentful, so the posts
were never in git. During migration we discovered `theoverengineered.blog` **no longer exists**
— the domain expired and is parked for sale on Sedo (€500). The posts existed nowhere live.
They were recovered from an **April 2021 Wayback Machine snapshot** by pulling `__NEXT_DATA__`
out of the archived pages, which still carried the original Contentful payload — so titles,
dates, summaries and tags are the author's originals, corroborated against the archived
`rss.xml`. Code in the wiremock and Maven posts lived in client-rendered gist embeds with no
`src` in the HTML; it was recovered from the GitHub gists API.

This is the strongest possible argument for the premise of this repo. Content in a CMS behind
a domain you forgot to renew is content you do not own. Markdown in git is.

**Decisions taken:**
- **Self-host all images** in `public/`. Do not hotlink `images.ctfassets.net` — it is a CDN
  tied to a Contentful space that may not be under his control, which is the same failure mode
  that just destroyed the old blog.
- **Dates kept as the old site rendered them** (UTC). Contentful stored midnight SGT, so
  `2020-12-20T00:00+08:00` rendered as Dec 19. Matching the rendering keeps them consistent
  with the archived RSS and any surviving inbound links.
- Two images are unrecoverable: a site-relative SVG in `initial-post` and a hotlinked JPEG in
  `use-docker-for-local-development`. Recreate or drop them during implementation.

## Testing

- **Vitest** — profile schema validation, markdown pipeline, post loading and draft filtering.
- **Playwright** — smoke test over the production build: every route renders, feed is valid,
  the About page's manifest block matches the contents of `me.yaml` on disk.

That last assertion is worth writing explicitly: it is the test that guards the thesis.

## Infrastructure

- Vercel deploy (project `anuragashok-com`, scope `anuragashoks-projects`).
- **`anuragashok.com` wired to the domain.** Currently 404s. A branding hub on a `vercel.app`
  subdomain is not a branding hub. **Registrar: Cloudflare.**

## Explicitly out of scope

Syndication. GitHub README / LinkedIn generation. Projects page. `/now`. `/uses`. Email setup
for `hello@anuragashok.com`. All tracked as GitHub issues.

## Open dependencies

None. Post migration is complete; registrar is confirmed (Cloudflare). Implementation can start.

One decision sits outside this repo and is tracked as an issue: **`theoverengineered.blog` is
for sale.** Anyone can buy the domain his old technical writing is still linked from. Either
buy it back and 301 it to the new site, or accept the dead inbound links.
